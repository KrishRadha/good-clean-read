## connecting academia and industry with [Rainspectra](http://rainspectra.com "Rain Spectra Strategy")
<hr>

Over 60 percent of as many as eight lakh engineers stayed unemployed last year after their graduation as per All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). Statistics such as these , push us to think that the industry and the academia do not go hand in hand. With more and more people turning to graduate studies and the industry getting saturated, we see a decline in professional skill development in students, during their education.

With the recent reforms from the HRD Minister, constraining engineering students to have 3 internship courses during their course of study, the environment is only going to get better. But for this to have an effective role, there has to be a seamless interface between Academia and Industry.

At Rain Spectra, we carefully observe the Education vertical , to serve our clients better and better. To get their students equipped with professional certifications, is one of the challenges that we are addressing rigourously. Having spread into HR and Strategy, we analysed that Industry as of today , has to organise its efforts and can open their Future , Research projects to the students, to get them started. 

This will be beneficiable to both Companies and Students as both of them grow together. Companies, will get better perspectives and contemporary knowledge into their systems, while the students will have their Experience laid out.

Keeping this as focus, Rain Spectra launches a ambitious campaign 
> Launch Pad.

At Launch Pad, we offer colleges a platform which equips students with In-Demand courses and further supports the students to connect with the Industry , to have hands-on experience. With the clientile we have on the both sides of the Spectrum , Our courses are widely appreciated and Launch Pad is sought out by most of the companies for their Flagship projects.
